### MY PROJECT DOCUMENTATION.
I started my data analysis jurney class with Incubator Hub, where i learnt very interesting topics ranging 
from MS Excel, Sql and PowerBI.
Kultra Mega Stores Inventory
Project Overview
Kultra Mega Stores specializes in office supplies and furniture, serving a diverse customer base
that includes individual consumers, small retail businesses, and large corporate clients across
three Nigerian states. I was assigned to support the Abuja division. The Business Manager
provided a dataset containing order records from 2009 to 2012 and tasked me with analyzing
the data to extract and present key insights and findings.
Data Source: The dataset was sourced from (Digital Skillup Africa) Incubator Hub
Method and Tools
Data Cleaning: Conducted in Microsoft Excel to eliminate errors, handle missing values, and
ensure the dataset was properly structured for analysis.
Data Exploration: Utilized SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to explore
data patterns, distributions, and relationships.
GitHub: Used as a platform to document and showcase the project as part of my professional
portfolio.

CONCLUSION :
This project reveals that Technology and Office Supplies are Kultra Mega Storesâ€™
highest-performing product categories. The Corporate and Consumer segments contribute the
most to revenue, highlighting an opportunity for targeted strategies to drive additional sales.
Instances of negative profit suggest potential product returns, signaling the need to enhance
customer satisfaction. By focusing on best-selling products, high-value customer segments, and
minimizing returns, Kultra Mega Stores can significantly improve overall business performance
