--The company did not appropriately spend shipping costs based on Order Priority.
-- Express Air, the most expensive shipping mode, was used for small and Not Specified priority orders, 
--which conflicting cost-efficiency principles. Delivery Truck, the slowest method, was occasionally used for High or Critical orders.
-- The company did not always match shipping cost with urgency, suggesting potential inefficiencies in logistics planning.
